This is a proof of concept for an automatic struct editor.

The intended purpose is to allow editing configs for long-running services.


It is using https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor/ and all its dependencies.  Most of which have been brought in as specific versions to be bundled.


At some point this will be a library instead of a main executable.
